            <h2>Code of Condut</h2>
            <hr class="divider">
            <h3>Do the following</h3>
            <p><b>Be civil.</b> Don't say things you wouldn't say face-to-face. Don't be snarky. Comments should get more civil and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.</p>
            <p>When disagreeing, please <b>reply to the argument instead of calling names.</b> "That is idiotic; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3" can be shortened to "1 + 1 is 2, not 3."</p>
            <p>Please <b>respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says</b>, not a weaker one that's easier to criticize.</p>
            <p><b>Assume no malice</b> - Humans make mistakes, and disagreements or differences of opinion are a fact of life. Try to approach conflict from the perspective that people generally mean well. This will promote a respectful and friendly atmosphere where people feel comfortable asking questions, participating in discussions, and making contributions.</p>
        
            <h3>Don't do the following</h3>
            <p><b>You may not threaten violence towards others</b> or organize, promote, or incite acts of real-world violence or terrorism. Think carefully about the words you use, the images you post, and even the software you write, and how they may be interpreted by others. Even if you mean something as a joke, it might not be received that way. If you think that someone else might interpret the content you post as a threat, or as promoting violence or terrorism, stop. Don't post it. In extraordinary cases, threats may be reported to law enforcement if there is a genuine risk of harm</p>
            <p>While it is not forbidden to broach topics such as age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation, <b>we do not tolerate speech that attacks a person or group of people</b> on the basis of who they are. Just realize that when approached in an aggressive or insulting manner, these (and other) sensitive topics can make others feel unwelcome, or perhaps even unsafe. While there's always the potential for misunderstandings, we expect our community members to remain respectful and civil when discussing sensitive topics.</p>
            <p><b>We do not tolerate bullying or harassment.</b> This means any habitual badgering or intimidation targeted at a specific person or group of people. In general, if your actions are unwanted and you continue to engage in them, there's a good chance you are headed into bullying or harassment territory.</p>
            <p><b>Don't post other people's personal information</b>, such as phone numbers, private email addresses, physical addresses, credit card numbers, Social Security/National Identity numbers, or passwords. Depending on the context, such as in the case of intimidation or harassment, we may consider other information, such as photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent, to be an invasion of privacy, especially when such material presents a safety risk to the subject.</p>
            <p><b>Don't post pornography.</b> This does not mean that all nudity or sexual content is prohibited. We recognize that sexuality is a part of life and non-pornographic sexual content may be a part of your project, or may be presented for educational or artistic purposes. If you have any questions or concerns about something you want to post, feel free to reach out and ask beforehand.</p>
            <p><b>Don't go looking for loopholes in the rules.</b> We expect you to conduct yourself in a dignified, responsible manner. If nothing else, use common sense. If you wouldn't want somebody to a thing to you, that's a good sign you shouldn't do it to anyone else. </p>
        
            <p>Finally, please ensure you are following the <a class="link" href="https://toplevel.design/policy">.gay Rights Protection Policy.</a></p>
